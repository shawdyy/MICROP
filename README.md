# MICROP
MICROP is a Framework and Application for Movable Ink Studio to use DataSources without using the Movable Ink Datasource functionality. This is useful for building demos when the normal Datasource functionality doesn’t work. It’s also faster to make edits on the data source inside of Studio because you don’t need to leave the studio platform.
